			The importance of environmental science and environmental studies cannot be disputed. The need for sustainable development is a key to the future of mankind. 
			Continuing problems of pollution, loss of forget, solid waste disposal, degradation of environment, issues like economic productivity and national security, Global warming, 
			the depletion of ozone layer and loss of biodiversity have made everyone aware of environmental issues. The United Nations Coference on Environment and Development 
			held in <b> Rio de Janerio </b> in 1992 and world Summit on Sustainable Development at Johannesburg in 2002 have drawn the attention of people around the globe to the 
			deteriorating condition of our environment. It is clear that no citizen of the earth can afford to be ignorant of environment issues. Environmental management has captured the 
			attention of health care managers. Managing environmental hazards has become very important.

			Human beings have been interested in ecology since the beginning of civilization. Even our ancient scriptures have emphasized about practices and values of environmental 
			conservation. It is now even more critical than ever before for <i> mankind </i> as a whole to have a clear understanding of environmental concerns and to follow sustainable 
			development practices.
